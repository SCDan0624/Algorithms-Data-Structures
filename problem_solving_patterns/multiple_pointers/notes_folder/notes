Multiple Pointers

    Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move 
    toward the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition.

    Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

Example

    Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers. 
    This function should find the first pair where the sum is 0.

    Return an array that includes both values that 
    sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not
    exist.

sumZero([-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,4]) // [-3,3]
sumZero([-2,0,1,3]) // undefined
sumZero([1,2,3]) // undefined
