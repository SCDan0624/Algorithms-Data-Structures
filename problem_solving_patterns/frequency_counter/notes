1) Frequency Counter

    A) This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequency of values.

    B) This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings.

2) Example

    A) Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays. 
    The function should return true if every value in the array 
    has it's corresponding value squared in the array. 
    The frequency of the values must be the same.
